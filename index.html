We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.) from social networking systems on which you have used FLYINGTURTLE's network (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
